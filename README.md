# waiting-time
Waiting Times have always been a key policy driver for the health and social care system. The use of intelligence and data around waiting times will support the system and improve our experience with it. At 31 March 2022, the number of patients who were waiting to be seen is 36.8% higher than the average at the end of quarters in 2019 [1], revealing that it is necessary to look at means of prevention to stop the demand. This report aims to assist Public Health Scotland (PHS) in fully understanding drivers and the demand for waiting times of inpatients and day cases. We hope that this will contribute to the improvement of the PHS health and social care system.
In the following section, we will classify the process of combining optional drivers from massive data sets and introduce the data, as well as perform exploratory data analysis. We then explain the regression models that were used. We compare the effect of models in Section 5 and present our findings in Section 6. Finally, we discuss and conclude the information and intelligence that allows people to better understand the drivers of waiting times and future demand.
